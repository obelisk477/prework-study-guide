# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework study guide was put together to help agglomerate notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git that were learned during the pre-bootcamp period. Instead of forgetting each section as it was completed, this allowed the user to keep track of what was learned
