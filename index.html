          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage and can improve crawlability by search engines</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML calls for using as many semantically tags/elements as possible to make code more readable and accessible</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>For simplifying margin or padding CSS, you can start with 'top-bottom' pixels, and then do 'left-right' pixels, so as to only have two numbers</li>
          <li><code>padding</code> makes an element larger, and exists *inside* the element</li>
          <li><code>margin</code> adds space to the *outside* of the element</li>
          <li><code>display: block;</code> indicates that each item should occupy a new line</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is one of the primary ways that developers handle the problem of version control</li>
          <li>Git flow is the process of iteratively updating and mantaining code in GitHub as issues are worked through and features are added</li>
          <li>SSH keys can be attached to personal devices and uploaded to GitHub to automatically connect to GitHub without having to log in every time</li>
          <li>Feature branches should be created before beginning work on the code in your repository so as not to mess up the main branch</li>
